# machine-learning-iris-classification-algo
This repository demonstrates a complete introductory machine learning project using Python. It covers the key stages from data loading to model deployment readiness:

1. Downloading and Installing Python (SciPy stack)
2. Loading the Dataset
3. Summarizing the Dataset
4. Visualizing the Dataset
5. Evaluating Different Machine Learning Algorithms
6. Making Predictions with the Best Model
